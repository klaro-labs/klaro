# Human Actions Needed

Things outside code that gate full verification or launch.

## 🟡 P1 — verification env for live multi-wallet E2E

Disputes persistence is wired + gate-verified (typecheck/lint/103 web tests/11 daemon tests/517 forge). The §9 "verified like a real user" step — drive open → evidence → on-chain `decide` → daemon flips the Supabase row, asserting BOTH on-chain state AND the DB row — needs the live stack the sandbox blocks:

- Web dev server on `:3100`, local Redis (`klaro-redis`), daemon with `KLARO_RUN_QUEUE_WORKER=1`
- Arc testnet RPC reachable, Supabase pooler reachable
- The 3 test wallets funded (operator / vendor / LP)

Run `apps/web/scripts/qa-dispute-drive.mjs` (extend it to assert the `disputes` Supabase row mirrors the on-chain DECIDED outcome) on a machine with that access. Until then disputes persistence ships gate-verified, E2E-pending.
